In [a previous post]({% post_url 2025-05-22-dnd-homebrew-forgefire-adept-class %}) I shared a homebrew class I made as a way to adapt Dragonfire Adept to a non-dragon flavor, while keeping the core of the mechanics. In [my last post]({% post_url 2025-05-26-dnd-homebrew-forgefire-variants %}) I shared some variants for this class. This will be the last post on this topic for the forseeable future. This time around, I'll be sharing a bundle of prestige classes that reuse the last dregs of discarded concepts from the Forgefire Adept class.

### Thundersmith PrC

When working on the Forgefire Adept, I really wanted to add it some features that were centered on the crafting aspect of the class. In the end I settled for simply giving free crafting feats, because I didn't want the class to get any more cluttered or complex. Those crafting ideas ended up bundled in a new Prestige Class called **Thundersmith**.

The fantasy behind the class is Hephaestus in the Disney animated Hercules movie, crafting the lightning spears that Zeus uses against the titans. That is, a crafting class that can take pure lightning and hammer it into shape to create the stuff of legends. It is a 5-level Prestige Class with full caster progression (except first level) that provides a number features related to lightning damage, lighting resistance, crafting speed and crafting items specifically related to lightning.

As soon as I finished making the class I went on to make variants that deal with other energy types that aren't lightning. As such **Flamesmith**, **Coldsmith** and **Lightsmith** were created, dealing with fire, cold and holy/divine respectively.

As always, you can check it out in the D&D wiki ([Thundersmith](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Thundersmith_(3.5e_Prestige_Class)), [Flamesmith](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Flamesmith_(3.5e_Alternate_Class_Feature)), [Coldsmith](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Coldsmith_(3.5e_Alternate_Class_Feature)), [Lightsmith](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Coldsmith_(3.5e_Alternate_Class_Feature))), [the Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/JG5eCIvtDTYO) or just [download it as a PDF]({% link /assets/files/thundersmith_et_al.pdf %}).
