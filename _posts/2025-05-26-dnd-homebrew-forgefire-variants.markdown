In [the previous post]({% post_url 2025-05-22-dnd-homebrew-forgefire-adept-class %}) I shared a homebrew class I made as a way to adapt Dragonfire Adept to a non-dragon flavor, while keeping the core of the mechanics. As I did that, I worked with a number of ideas that didn't make the cut into the class. It felt a pity to throw away some of those ideas, so they were packaged into either Class Variants or complementing Prestige Classes.

I will share the Class Variants this time, and we'll go over the Prestige Classes in some future occasion.

### Forgehammer Adept: A Forgefire Adept Variant

The original class had some hammer-related features, but as a Dragonfire Adept spin-off, it prominently featured breath attacks and breath effects as class progression features. I allowed for more hammer-oriented folks to ditch the breath weapon by providing the Forgehammer invocation as early as level 1. However, the fact of the matter remained that in using that you were forgoing breath effects. At some point during the original ideation I thought about offering hammer effects too but the original class became too cluttered and as such most of that stuff was packaged into its own variant.

Just like before, you can check it out [in the D&D wiki](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Forgehammer_Adept_(3.5e_Alternate_Class_Feature)), [the Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/edit/JxzOMZ5Ztxq7) or just [download it as a PDF]({% link /assets/files/forgehammer_adept.pdf %}).

### Faerieforge Adept: Another Forgefire Adept Variant

Fittingly enough, I made this variant on a whim. I think I woke up one day with this concept in my mind and I just did it for no real reason. If the original Forgefire Adept was rather Cleric-like in some aspects, this one would be its Druid counterpart. It changes the flavor from stone, iron and fire to wood, meadows and faerie fire.

Like before, you can find it in [the D&D wiki](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Faerie_Forge_Adept_(3.5e_Alternate_Class_Feature)), [the Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/qEYyrNPxSGpH) or just [download it as a PDF]({% link /assets/files/faerieforge_adept.pdf %}).

### PCGen files

Since I haven't actually played these variants, there are no PCGen files to share for them. Same will be true for the Prestige Classes whenever I get around them.
