In this post I'll talk about a homebrew class I made, and share some files for it.

### Context and Motivation

I had a more-or-less clear idea of the character concept I wanted to go for. I wanted to play an old dwarf who has retired from being "support" for a professional monster hunter. In the past, he would research the books and create the equipment, etc so that his mate could then go kill the things. Think something like Abraham Whistler from the Blade movie. Except this one would be a dwarf. 

In the actual campaign he's going to step into combat for his first time, and when he does he won't be hiding behind young people with more to live for. So, putting that together with other concerns, my list of requirements looked something like:
+ Old guy modifiers (-3 all physical stats, +2 all mental stats)
+ Craft/Knowledge as big focus (=> High Int)
+ I'm taking hits (=> Decent Con)
+ Some magic is acceptable (Bless, etc), but I don't want him to be a spellcaster.
+ Preferably not useless in combat
+ Simple to play and understand (no crazy multiclassing, no templates, etc)

With this list of things I looked at the available classes and **Dragonfire Adept** stood out to me as something mechanicallly aligned with what I had in mind. The flavor was completely off, but among the first invocations is one that boosts Knowledge, and the Fire Breath attack was a magic I was amenable to -- it seemed to mesh well with the Crafter-Dwarf concept. It was also able to participate in combat from up-close without requiring good Str or Dex (I wasn't getting those at my age!). 

All in all I could see my original concept leaning a bit more into his dwarven side and take a page from characters such as [Ornn from League of Legends](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/champion/ornn/), playing such a class. 

When I told my DM I was thinking on playing this class and just ignoring all the dragon-themed stuff (like flying, etc), he told me we could maybe think about alternatives that were more in line with the concept. I felt it was unfair to decide those things later on (too influenced by whatever is happening during play to resist the tempation of asking just the right substitutes), so I tried to work out all the substitutes ahead of time.

### Forgefire Adept (Hombrew class for 3.5e)

At the time I decided to write the new Forgefire Adept class in the [D&D wiki](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Main_Page). The class started as a simple reflavor of the original Dragonfire Adept where I would directly turn the word "Dragon" from things like "+4 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks made to influence a Dragon" to something else like "Fire and Earth elementals and outsiders", but as I made more changes, I saw more opportunities to make it distinct. [The bluez in the dungeon](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/User:The_bluez_in_the_dungeon) was incredibly helpful as well, and pushed me to improve the design of the class a great deal.

The class is available in a number of places:
+ The original wiki article is still there: <https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Forgefire_Adept_(3.5e_Class)>.
+ I have also written a version up in [the Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Iy4150pZX-ri).
+ And you can also [download it as a PDF]({% link /assets/files/forgefire_adept.pdf %}) right here.

Big ups to [Kaiburr Kathhound](https://ko-fi.com/kaiburrkathhound) for the 3.5e-styled template.

### PCGen files

I like using PCGen to manage my sheets, and in this instance that meant creating some custom files for my homebrew class, so I did. The support isn't perfect but it mostly got the job done to the extent that I needed it. You may also [download custom PCGen library files]({% link /assets/files/forgefire_lib.zip %}).
