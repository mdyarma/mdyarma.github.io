I don't know how long or how regularly I'll keep this up, but it's not like I had anything better to do these last couple of hours; so might as well.

The inciting motivation for starting this was having a platform to share things I have wasted time on such that it's possible for others to find them and benefit from them. At the time of writing this I have a couple of RPG related things in mind, so I'll probably start with those. 

I have no idea what will happen afterwards, maybe I keep coming up with things to share, or maybe I don't and it just stays barren like that. I'm fine either way.

Cheers.
